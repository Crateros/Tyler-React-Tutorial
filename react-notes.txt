Perhaps one of my favorite things about React is it's given me a light introduction to functional programming (FP) and a fundamental piece of FP are pure functions.

The whole concept of a pure function is consistency and predictability (which IMO are keys to writing great software).

The reason for the consistency and predictability is because pure functions have the following characteristics.

- Pure functions always return the same result given the same arguments.
- Pure function's execution doesn't depend on the state of the application.
- Pure functions don't modify the variables outside of their scope.

.slice (pure) vs .splice (not pure, mutates original array, so each call of .splice will be different)

Why is this important for React? Well the main reason is React's render method needs to be a pure function and because it's a pure function, all of the benefits of pure functions now apply to your UI as well
