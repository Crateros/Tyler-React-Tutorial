Imperative (How)

var numbers =[1,2,3,4,5];
var total = 0;
for (vari i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  total += numbers[i];
}

Can slightly optimize this, STILL Imperative though

for (var i = 0; len = numbers.length; i < len; i++)

--------------------------------------------------

Declarative (What)

var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
numbers.reduce(function (previous, current) {
  return previous + current;
});

-Less bugs / reduce side effects
-Minimizes mutability
-More readable code

array.reduce is quite a bit slower though....

React is mostly declarative

Except for this.setState --> take current state and change it somehow

-> React Composition = Components!

-> Explicit Mutations
Need to explicitly state when you want to change state inside a component using setState

-> React Router = Map components to certain URLs
-> Webpack = Bundler to make code faster and lighter, bundles code into one file, allowing transformations on that file
-> Babel = Compiles JSX to JavaScript so browser can interpret it, code transformation
-> Axios = HTTP requests
